    description: "The first-generation Mazda2 (known as the Demio in Japan) was introduced as Mazda's entry in the subcompact segment. Built on the Ford B3 platform shared with the fifth-generation Ford Fiesta, it featured a practical tall-boy design providing generous interior space within compact exterior dimensions. Development was led by chief engineer Kiyoshi Fujiwara. Production for the European market began on January 20, 2003 at the Almussafes Ford plant in Valencia, Spain. Powertrain options varied by market: Japanese models received 1.3L and 1.5L gasoline engines, while European models featured Ford's 1.25-liter Sigma engine and Mazda's 1.4L and 1.6L gasoline engines plus a 1.4L CDTi diesel. An innovative feature in Japan was e-4WD, a hybrid car-type system using an electric motor to power the rear wheels for traction assistance. All models were equipped with ABS and EBD, with stability control optional. Three trim levels were available in Japan: Cozy, Sport, and Casual. In Europe, trim levels were S, TS, and TS2 (later renamed Antares and Capella)."

    description: "The first-generation Mazda2 received a facelift on April 13, 2005. The refresh included updated exterior styling with revised front and rear bumpers, new headlights and taillights, and updated interior trim. The European version continued to use a pedal box sourced from the Ford Fiesta with their own 4x108 bolt pattern instead of 4x100. Engine and transmission options remained largely unchanged from the pre-facelift model. In 2004, Mazda introduced the Verisa in Japan, which was based on the Demio/Mazda2 but targeted further upmarket. The first generation established the Mazda2 as a practical city car focused on efficiency and maneuverability, though it lacked the sporty driving characteristics that would define later generations. It achieved moderate success in Europe and Japan but was not offered in North America."

    description: "The second-generation Mazda2 marked a significant evolution with a shift to a more conventional hatchback design that emphasized sportiness over the previous model's tall-boy practicality. Launched at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show and Shanghai International Motor Show, it was built on a platform shared with the sixth-generation Ford Fiesta. The lead designer was Ikuo Maeda, who was later promoted to Head of Design at Mazda in 2009. Notably lighter than its predecessor by approximately 100 kg due to Mazda's 'gram strategy,' it achieved improved fuel efficiency and more engaging driving dynamics. Available in both 3-door and 5-door configurations, the exterior featured expressive styling with flowing lines. For the Japanese domestic market, sales began on July 5, 2007. Production reached 100,000 units by the end of January 2008. Engine choices included MZR 1.3L and 1.5L gasoline engines and MZ-CD 1.4L turbo diesel. The second-generation Mazda2 earned the 2008 World Car of the Year title."

    description: "The second-generation Mazda2 received a facelift first revealed in Thailand in October 2009 and launched in Thailand and Indonesia in November 2009. The rollout continued to Malaysia in April 2010, Australia in May 2010 (with the introduction of the sedan body style), and Europe at the end of 2010 for the 2011 model year. The North American version debuted at the 2009 LA Auto Show and became available in July 2010 with a 1.5-liter, 100 hp four-cylinder engine and 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. In June 2011, Mazda introduced the 13-Skyactiv model featuring the first Skyactiv engine, a 1.3-liter Miller Cycle engine with i-DM intelligent driver monitoring and CVT transmission. The 13-Skyactiv was nominated for Car of the Year Japan in 2012. A limited production Demio EV with a 20 kWh lithium-ion battery was leased in Japan starting October 2012. Production ended in November 2014, with over 400,000 units sold in Europe, Australia, and Japan."

    description: "The third-generation Mazda2 embraces Mazda's Kodo 'Soul of Motion' design language and SkyActiv technology. Unveiled in July 2014, its design was previewed by the Mazda Hazumi Concept at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. Designed under chief designer Ryo Yanagisawa, it adopted Skyactiv-branded engines, transmissions, body, and chassis loosely derived from the CX-5. While featuring greater length and wider front and rear tracks, it offers decreased interior room compared to its predecessor. Production began at Mazda's Hōfu plant in July 2014, with sales in Japan beginning in September 2014. The sedan version debuted at the Thailand International Motor Expo in November 2014. Powertrains included Skyactiv-G 1.3L and 1.5L gasoline engines and a Skyactiv-D 1.5L turbo diesel. Transmissions included Skyactiv-MT 5/6-speed manual and Skyactiv-Drive 6-speed automatic with i-STOP stop-start system and i-ELOOP brake energy regeneration. In October 2014, the Demio was awarded the 2014–2015 'Car of the Year' by Japan's Japan Car of the Year Committee."

In 2020, a 1.5L mild hybrid gasoline engine was introduced, available only with a six-speed manual transmission, as the diesel engine was discontinued in Europe. The third-generation Mazda2 has been sold in North America through Toyota as the Scion iA (2016), Toyota Yaris iA (2017–2018), and Toyota Yaris Sedan (2019–2020), as well as a Toyota Yaris Hatchback starting in October 2019 for the 2020 model year."
