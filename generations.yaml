  - name: "First Generation (DY)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The first-generation Mazda2 (known as the Demio in Japan) was introduced as Mazda's entry in the subcompact segment. Built on the DY platform shared with the Ford Fiesta, it featured a practical tall-boy design providing generous interior space within compact exterior dimensions. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included 1.25L, 1.4L, and 1.6L gasoline engines, with some markets also receiving a 1.4L diesel option. Transmission choices included 4-speed automatic and 5-speed manual. The interior emphasized functionality with flexible seating configurations, good visibility, and straightforward controls. Standard equipment was modest but included essentials like power steering and dual airbags, with higher trims adding air conditioning, power windows, and upgraded audio systems. This generation established the Mazda2 as a practical city car focused on efficiency and maneuverability, though it lacked the sporty driving characteristics that would define later generations. It achieved moderate success in Europe and Japan but was not offered in North America."

    description: "The second-generation Mazda2 marked a significant evolution with a shift to a more conventional hatchback design that emphasized sportiness over the previous model's tall-boy practicality. Notably lighter than its predecessor by approximately 100 kg due to Mazda's engineering approach called 'gram strategy,' it achieved improved fuel efficiency and more engaging driving dynamics. Available in both 3-door and 5-door configurations, its exterior featured more expressive styling with flowing lines and a prominent grille. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included 1.3L and 1.5L gasoline engines, with some regions receiving a 1.6L diesel option. Transmission choices included 4-speed automatic, 5-speed manual, and in some markets, a 6-speed automatic. The interior offered improved materials and design compared to its predecessor, though still focused on simplicity and functionality. This generation was introduced to North America for the first time in 2010, where it was well-received for its engaging handling and efficiency. Awards included 2008 World Car of the Year and various regional car of the year honors. This model established the modern Mazda2's reputation for delivering driving enjoyment in the subcompact segment, previewing the brand's future direction emphasizing driving dynamics and design."

The exterior features a more premium, sculpted appearance with a prominent shield-shaped grille, flowing body lines, and available LED lighting. Built on Mazda's SkyActiv platform, it benefits from significantly improved structural rigidity and reduced weight. Powertrain options include SkyActiv-G gasoline engines ranging from 1.3L to 1.5L depending on market, with the 1.5L offering up to 115 horsepower. Some markets also received a 1.5L SkyActiv-D diesel option. Transmission choices include 6-speed manual and 6-speed automatic. The interior represents a major upgrade with higher quality materials, more sophisticated design, and improved technology including an available 7-inch touchscreen with rotary controller and MZD Connect infotainment system. Active safety features expanded to include Smart City Brake Support, Lane Departure Warning, and available adaptive LED headlights. This generation was briefly offered in North America as the Toyota Yaris sedan and hatchback through a partnership between the manufacturers. In 2019, a refresh brought subtle styling updates, improved sound insulation, and enhanced safety features. For 2022, some markets received a hybrid variant through a partnership with Toyota, based on the Yaris Hybrid. Throughout its production, the third-generation Mazda2 has maintained Mazda's focus on driving dynamics while adding more premium features, sophisticated design, and improved efficiency, positioning it as one of the more upscale and engaging options in the subcompact segment."
